# Who we are
> How can the the European Championships Munich 2022 motivate their visitors and spectactors to do more sports and inspire them to lead more active lifestyles, creating a positive impact for local sport clubs and society as a whole?
 
We are team Champs2Be consisting of six students from Germany, Hungary, Bosnia and the United States working together on a challenge given by the [European Championships 2022](https://www.europeanchampionships.com/2022munich). Our [team](https://github.com/gxc-int-innovation-challenge21/gxc-team-23/graphs/contributors) consists of:
* Aron ([@hrbiaron](https://github.com/hrbiaron))
* Cameron ([@camcausey](https://github.com/camcausey))
* Florian ([@1fischer](https://github.com/1fischer))

For our challenge giver we have developed a solution to encourage digital natives to see physical activity as integral part of their lives and motivate them to engage in challenges to have a positive impact on their lives, environment and the society in general.

We've therefore conducted intensive research and analysis of our target group and developed the [prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/Gk8E12tlZANyTBdmQMUHqA/Champs2Be) of a sports app which provides a unique combination of personal challenges and habit creation with a competitive and event-based aspect specifically tailored to the preferences of the user. In addition the solution incorporates the wishes of our challenge giver to integrate large sport event and strengthen social communities in the form of local sport clubs.

Our prototype can be run in normal web browsers like Firefox, Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge by clicking the following link or copying its address in the top bar of the browser: https://www.figma.com/file/Gk8E12tlZANyTBdmQMUHqA/Champs2Be

More information about our solution can also be found on our [website](https://gxc-int-innovation-challenge21.github.io/gxc-team-23).

# How we do it
During the ten weeks of the challenge we have conducted a lot of research following a process with the following steps:

* **Team building & Research**: During this phase we set up our team communication, got to know each other with the help of a [Team Canvas](https://github.com/gxc-int-innovation-challenge21/gxc-team-23/wiki/Team-Canvas) and started to develop a common understanding of the [problem and users](https://github.com/gxc-int-innovation-challenge21/gxc-team-23/wiki/Empathy-Map-and-Problem-Statement). In addition the first [research](https://github.com/gxc-int-innovation-challenge21/gxc-team-23/wiki/Challenge-and-Problem-Research) and [interviews](https://github.com/gxc-int-innovation-challenge21/gxc-team-23/wiki/Conducted-Interviews) were conducted to get to know our planned target group. 
* **Ideation & Prototyping**: After understanding the problem, we iteratively created multiple low-fidelity prototypes in the form of a [storyboard](https://github.com/gxc-int-innovation-challenge21/gxc-team-23/wiki/Storyboard), collected feedback and turned this into our interactive [first prototype](https://github.com/gxc-int-innovation-challenge21/gxc-team-23/wiki/Sprint-1:-Prototype-App-Design). In a second iteration we collected more user feedback and refined our [second prototype](https://github.com/gxc-int-innovation-challenge21/gxc-team-23/wiki/Sprint-2:-Second-Prototype-Iteration) with it.
* **Business Model**: In parallel to the creation of the prototype it was necessary to assess the viability of the idea. With the help of the [Business Model Canvas](https://github.com/gxc-int-innovation-challenge21/gxc-team-23/wiki/Business-Model-Canvas) it was possible to create a business model and focus our efforts on the core value delivered to our customers.
* **Final Report & Reflection**: After the completion of our prototype, we summarized the work in the form of an [Elevator Pitch](https://github.com/gxc-int-innovation-challenge21/gxc-team-23/blob/main/05%20-%20Presentation%20%26%20Report/Elevetor-Pitch_PDF.pdf) and a full [15-Minute-Pitch](https://prezi.com/view/yCNgEl4Dc2LND4d6ShRo/) and reflected on [Lessons Learnt](https://github.com/gxc-int-innovation-challenge21/gxc-team-23/wiki/Team-Reflection).
