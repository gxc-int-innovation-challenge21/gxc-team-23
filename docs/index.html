    <h2>Our Idea</h2>
    <img align="right" height="300" src="img/storyboard.png" />
    <p>We have found out, that many digital natives are struggling to develop a healthy and active lifestyle. The
        research research motivated us to develop a prototype which incorporates community, environmental
        consciousness, long-term motivation and sports in a single app.</p>
    <p>We intended to stay near our target group and tailor our idea specifically to the needs we identified by
        integrating local sport clubs, regional events as well as personal challenges and goals to create a
        motivating combination of personal challenge and habit creation with a competitive aspect.</p>

<div style="display: inline-block; width: 100%;">
    <h2>Our Solution</h2>

    <img align="left" height="300" src="img/challengesel.png" />
    <p>The complete interactive prototype can be found <a
            href="https://www.figma.com/file/Gk8E12tlZANyTBdmQMUHqA/Champs2Be?node-id=0%3A1">here</a> on Figma which
        is our contribution to the challenge.</p>
    <p>After following the introductory sign-up and sign-in procedure the users are able to choose their
        challenges...</p>

    <img align="right" height="300" src="img/reminders.png" />
    <img align="right" height="300" src="img/challengeintro.png" />
    <p>... where they can choose between different types of sports, set reminders and select challenges, either the
        more personal milestone and habit challenges or the competitions against another users.</p>
    <p>Users can remind themselves why they do it to stay on track for reaching an improvement in the long run.</p>

    <img align="left" height="300" src="img/clubchallenge.png" />
    <img align="left" height="300" src="img/eventchallenge.png" />
    <p>Once set up on the home screen you can see active challenges and regional events. Every challenge is a
        commitment to yourself to reach a personal goal. In addition to the personal challenges there are events
        which allow users to participate in virtual challenges against many other users who also use the Champs2Be
        app.</p>

    <img align="right" height="300" src="img/statsport.jpg" />
    <img align="right" height="300" src="img/tracker.png" />
    <p>Progress in the challenges is tracked and can be viewed in the form of classic charts or in the form of the
        ChampsForest. The ChampsForest is the visual representation of achievements and personal growth.</p>

    <p>For every specific number of virtual trees planted users get the possibility to plant a real tree and get a
        free
        trial which is then planted by our partners. The positive impact of the user is than shown to put the
        positive
        impact on society in relation to the personal growth for oneself.</p>
