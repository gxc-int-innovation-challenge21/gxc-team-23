> _The way to collective success lies in long individual improvement_
<br/>
We are team Champs2Be and we have developed a prototype app as our contribution for the [GXC International Virtual Innovation Challenge](https://www.hm.edu/en/international/projects_1/gxc/gxc_virtual_innovation_challenge.en.html) for the [European Championships 2022](https://www.europeanchampionships.com/2022munich). Below you will find all information about our the chellenge our idea and prototype.
<br/><br/><br/><br/>

## Our Idea
<img align="right" height="300" src="https://github.com/gxc-int-innovation-challenge21/gxc-team-23/blob/main/02%20-%20Storyboard/Storyboard-Final.png" />

We have found out, that many digital natives are struggling to develop a healthy and active lifestyle. The research research motivated us to develop a prototype which incorporates community, environmental consciousness, long-term motivation and sports in a single app.


We intended to stay near our target group and tailor our idea specifically to the needs we identified by integrating local sport clubs, regional events as well as personal challenges and goals to create a motivating combination of personal challenge and habit creation with a competitive aspect.

## Our Prototype

The complete interactive prototype can be found [here on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/Gk8E12tlZANyTBdmQMUHqA/Champs2Be?node-id=0%3A1) which is our contribution to the challenge.

After following the introductory sign-up and sign-in procedure the users are able to choose their challenges...

... where they can choose between different types of sports, set reminders and select challenges, either the more personal milestone and habit challenges or the competitions against another users. 

Users can remind themselves why they do it to stay on track for reaching an improvement in the long run.

Once set up on the home screen you can see active challenges and regional events. Every challenge is a commitment to yourself to reach a personal goal. In addition to the personal challenges there are events which allow users to participate in virtual challenges against many other users who also use the Champs2Be app.

Progress in the challenges is tracked and can be viewed in the form of classic charts or in the form of the ChampsForest. The ChampsForest is the visual representation of achievements and personal growth.

For every specific number of virtual trees planted users get the possibility to plant a real tree and get a free trial which is then planted by our partners. The positive impact of the user is than shown to put the positive impact on society in relation to the personal growth for oneself.

In addition it is possible to stay in contact with friends and acquaintances over the app and view their progress and status in mutual challenges.
